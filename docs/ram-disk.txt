; The ram-disk mapping into the RAM memory space
;=============================================================================

RAM mapping is applied if:
	- RAM mapping is enabled
	- The RAM is accessed via non-stack instructions
	- The address falls within the RAM mapping range associated with the current RAM mapping

Stack mapping is applied if:
	- Stack mapping is enabled
	- The RAM is accessed via stack-related instructions:
		Push, Pop, XTHL, Call, Ret, conditional calls/returns, or RST

Special case:
	If stack mapping is disabled but RAM mapping is enabled, RAM mapping applies to stack operations 
	if the stack address falls within the RAM mapping range.

The ram-disk activation command is E8ASssMM:
	MM: The index of the Ram-Disk 64k page accessed via non-stack instructions (all instructions except mentioned below)
	ss: The index of the RAM-Disk 64k page accessed via stack instructions (Push, Pop, XTHL, Call, Ret, C*, R*, RST)
	S : Enable stack mapping
	A : Enable RAM mapping for range [0xA000-0xDFFF]
	8 : Enable RAM mapping for range [0x8000-0x9FFF]
	E : Enable RAM mapping for range [0xE000-0xFFFF]
