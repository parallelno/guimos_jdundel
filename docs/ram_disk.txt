; The RAM Disk
;===============================================================================
; The RAM Disk is an external 256-byte RAM space. It is split into four 64k
; memory pages. It operates in two modes:
;
;   • Stack Mode:
;       - Accessed using stack-related instructions
;
;   • Memory-Mapped Mode:
;       - The RAM Disk is mapped into the 0xA000–0xFFFF address space
;       - The RAM Disk memory space operates as a regular RAM
;
; Stack Mode is applied if:
;   - Stack mapping is enabled
;   - The RAM is accessed via stack-related instructions:
;       Push, Pop, XTHL, Call, Ret, conditional calls/returns, or RST

; Memory-Mapped Mode is applied if:
;	- RAM mapping is enabled
;	- The address falls within the RAM mapping range associated with the current
;       RAM mapping
;	- The RAM is accessed via non-stack instructions when Stack Mode is enabled
;   - The RAM is accessed via stack instructions when Stack Mode is disabled
		Example:
		 Memory-Mapped Mode of the first RAM Disk is enabled.
		 Memory Mapping is enabled for 0xA000-0xDFFF.
		 Stack Mode is disabled.
		 SP = 0xA000
		 POP H
		In that case, the Memory-Mapped Mode is used to access the RAM Disk.

; The RAM Disk activation command: %E8ASssMM:
;	MM: The index of the RAM Disk 64k page accessed in the Stack Mode
;	ss: The index of the RAM Disk 64k page accessed in Memory-Mapped Mode
;	S : Enable Stack Mode
;	A : Enable Memory-Mapped Mode with mapping for range [0xA000-0xDFFF]
;	8 : Enable Memory-Mapped Mode with mapping for range [0x8000-0x9FFF]
;	E : Enable Memory-Mapped Mode with mapping for range [0xE000-0xFFFF]
